        "response": "The average yacht roughness is approximately 2.61, with a standard deviation of 0.29.  Higher roughness leads to uneven paint jobs.  Surfaces with lower roughness values are essential for a high-quality, long-lasting paint job.  The report details the roughness and `readyToPaint` status for 16 yacht IDs.  Some yachts require additional preparation before painting.\n",
